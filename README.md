# adventofcode_2024

All AoC 2024 solutions.

I have been refactoring my code all the time, and have also 
added a few solution variations based on discussions and 
some very clever ideas on reddit - thanks to Eric and 
everyone else for this year!

(This is a new GitHub account, AoC has been done as 'Rowlf'.)
